# TedTalks_RECOMMENDATION_SYSTEM

Ted talks are a good source to learn and take inspiration from. These days every platform is having a recommendation system to provide a better user experience.
Most of the applications collect data to recommend similar content according to the interests of the user. We can use the same strategy to recommend ted talks.

Ted Talks Recommendation System has to be purely based on the content rather than based on data of a user. 
As a user generally watches videos on Youtube and other applications mostly to get entertained. But a user watches Ted Talks to take some inspiration,
so the data of the user has nothing to do here.

To recommend Ted Talks to a user we need to create a content-based recommendation system where all the ted talks will be recommended based on the content 
of the video that the user watched earlier. To create such a system we can use the concept of cosine similarity in machine learning.
